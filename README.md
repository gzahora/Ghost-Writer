## Lets Dive in

### Sign-in

If you want to create your own account you can click the "Don't have an account?" button at the bottom of the page. Your unique ID and password will be saved to our database and encrpyted for your security.

### Getting Started

When you first login to the site you will be presented with a selection of other user stories that could use an update. These "In Progress" stories are created by other users that have some degree of completion and are waiting for you to continue them!

 If you would like to pick a story of a specific genre you can also do that by using the dropdown button at the top of the page. By clicking any of these stories you will be taken to that stories page which will allow you to continue the adventure with your own ideas!

### Adding to a Story

When you are taken to a specific stories in progress page you will see its divided into two parts. On the right side you can see every other users addition to the story. Use this a basis for what you are about to write!

 On the left side you will see that the part you are about to add has already been selected for you. All you need to do now is get the creative juices flowing and complete your section.
